Q.Differentiate Between Compiler and Interpreter.?

->Compiler:

1.Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.

2.It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code 
but the overall execution time is comparatively faster.

3.Generates intermediate object code which further 
requires linking, hence requires more memory.

4.Programming language like C, C++ use compilers.


->Interpreter

1.Translates program one statement at a time.

2.No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient.

3.Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters.

4.It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code
but the overall execution time is slower.
