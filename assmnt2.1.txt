Q.Java Architecture.?

 ->  bachelor's degree in a related field, such as computer science or information science is usually necessary for most Java architect positions. 
     These programs typically cover programming languages, data management, systems and software architecture, networks and security.
  

1. Compilation and interpretation:

-> Java combines both the approaches of compilation and interpretation.
First, java compiler compiles the source code into bytecode. At the run time,
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets this bytecode and generates machine code 
which will be directly executed by the machine in which java program runs.
 
2. JVM(Java Virtual Machine):

->JVM is a component which provides an environment for running Java programs. 
JVM interprets the bytecode into machine code which will be executed the machine in which the Java program runs.

3. JRE and Java Architecture:

->Java Runtime Environment contains JVM, class libraries and other supporting components.
This bytecode will be stored in class files. During runtime, this bytecode will be loaded.
verified and   JVM interprets the bytecode into machine code which will be executed in the 
machine in which the Java program runs.

a.Java Runtime Environment performs main tasks respectively.

1. Loads the class
This is done by the class loader

2. Verifies the bytecode
This is done by bytecode verifier.

3. Interprets the bytecode
This is done by the JVM
